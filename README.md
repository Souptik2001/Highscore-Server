# A lightweight, easy to use, customizable Highscore Server.

No login, no personal data! Creating a leaderboard is as simple as **just clicking a button.** Then you will get an upload key and a download key. You can upload and download data by just **sending GET requests to different api and passing data only through the url**. *POST request, query parameters, etc. are not needed at all*.  
You can set sorting order for each column of the table **seperatly through the url only**, no pre-configuration required. Every time you request data you can **specify the data sorting order.**    
As it uses sqlite so no connection to external database server is required. As it uses a local file database so it is somewhat faster than using an external database server.

**N.B** - *I made this in about 2 days for a game that I was working on during a Game Jam. It is ready to use, but there may be some optimization or security issues. If any one finds any issues then feel free to raise an issue and let me know.*    
Thank you.
